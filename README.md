## Common Advice : 
       1. Practise a lot problems on code forces of just above your rating range.
       2. Codeforces is only the site that will improve competitive programming , so give priority and spend a lot of times on it
       3. Next is atcoder , give atcoder beginner contest are really nice for beginners and to practise.
       4. You can also give atcoder regular contest.
       5. Use Codechef for maths and bit manipulation question.
       6. You can give codechef starters contests are good.
       7. Leetcode weekly and biweekly can also be given in order to practise as well as warm up, since 3/4 questions are easy and medium , so it will improve your motivation.

## tips:
### 1. stuck in contest :
       take 1 or 2 min break, wash face and start again with freshness
### 2. can't improve :
       try to upsolve, no idea comming see editorial and if un-none topic learn it, repeat this
### 3. how to boost performance:
       always and almost long challanges on codechef helps to boost performance and learn various tips and techniques
### 4. how to combine different approach and solve problem : 
       let's say there is a problem and you performed below steps
       1. the problem is of graph , dfs -> not enought to solve a problem ?
       2. using disjoint set -> yes -> but tle
       3. using path compression -> yes -> but wrong answer on some edge case
       4. oh , look at the constraints , can we use fenwick tree? yes -> Solved -> AC
       these are the steps that how to combine different approaches
### 5. Can not solve last 3 to 4 problem of contest :
       If your basics are clear , then you need to practise a lot of problems of tree,graph,dp, segment trees,
       until you feel satisfied enough
### 6. Where and how to practise :
       1.always hackerrank is good to learn a language for beginners
       2. after having little grip on 1 language, go to codeforces problem set
       3. on codeforces problem set solve problem of rating < 1000
       4. solve topic wise problem on codeforces problem set
       5. give contest on codeforces and codechef
       6. upsolve problems , if can not solve in 30 mins , see editorial, if unnone topic , learn it, and repeat this
       7. after rating growth, repeat  step-4 and solve problems of rating range [your rating -100 , your rating + 100]
       8. keep learning new algo and practice them
### 7. How problem setters every time finds and puts new problem in contest : 
       see , its not that every problem was built from scratch , 
       most of the problems in contests are mixture of more than one problem of below cses sheet.
       
### CSES SHEET : [cses sheet](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
       
### 8. Which ide should i use ?
       Don't use ide in competitive programming , make a habit of using vim editor.
       
### vim-configuration
       set number
       set tabstop=4
       set shiftwidth=4
       set autoindent
       set mouse=a
       colorscheme default
       autocmd vimEnter *.cpp map ^B :w <CR> :!clear ; g++ --std=c++17 %;if[[-f Output : ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++] a.out ];time ./a.out; rm a.out; if[[-f End : --------------------------------]a.out]<CR>
  
### Note : 

  ### do below commands : 
  
      vi ~/.vimrc

      //then write above code of vim-configuration

      press ctrl-c and then ctrl-b to compile and run the code
  
### vim is the one of the best suitable editor for competitive programming in the world.
  
### 9. Which template should i use in cp?
       Oops , there are two much templates, look below reference.
       
### [templates useful for cp](https://iq.opengenus.org/cpp-template-for-competitive-coding/)
       
## codechef Roadmap
  1. start with array -> practice -> 2 ðŸŒŸ
  2. learn c++ stl or any language similar library, dp -> 3 ðŸŒŸ
  3. disjoint set union , graph, little dsa -> 4 ðŸŒŸ
  4. segment tree -> 5 ðŸŒŸ
  5. Codechef has very nice problems on Bit manipulation So , making good grip over bit manip can help in contest.

## Codeforces Suggestion 
  1. Codeforces requires speed of solving problems.
  2. Even if you solve only 2-3 problems , but very quickly then , you will get fruitful ratings.
  3. Upsolving is required since the problem pattern might be repeated in future problems.
  4. First two questions are mostly greedy in div -2,3,4 contests. No prior knowledge except programming language is required.
  5. Below is example how upsolving looks like

## note to me:

* number theory , bit manip and dp are most popular, 
* in 98% of the contest atleast one of them is always there,
* please practise more and more

Some basic constraints and the safe time complexity :
---
| N | Big Oh |
|-----|------|
|For N <= 10 | O(2^N) and O(N!)|
|For N <= 100 | O(N^3) |
|For N <= 10^3 | O(N^2) |
|For N <=10^5 | O(NLogN) [ Sorting/Greedy Algo] |
|For N <= 10^6 | O(N) |
|For N <= 10^9 | O(logN) |
